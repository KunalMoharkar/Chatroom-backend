# Chatroom-backend

Developed using `Node JS, Express JS` and `sockets.io` chatroom is a free to use API for building chat plugins for applications. It makes use of web sockets to establish a bidirectional, full duplex connection for real time experience. 
Chatroom puts privacy at its forefront as no messages are stored on the server or any external central database.
